Lets choose number of page frames n = 5.


1) 1 1 1 1 1 5 4 7 5 3 4 5 5 3 1 1 3 5 7 8

2) 1 9 23 4 5 6 7 8 3 5 6 2 3 5 34 98 70 57 43


Sequence 1) has high hit/miss proportion(14/6)

Sequence 2) has low hit/miss proportion(2/17)

This happened because in sequence 1 there are many same references that are close to each other. Probability that current refference is in page table is high.

In seq.2 there are almost all references are different and almost all same references are too far from each other.Probability that current refference is in page table is low.
